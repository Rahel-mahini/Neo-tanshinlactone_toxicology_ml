# Neo-Tanshinlactone Cytotoxicity Prediction Pipeline

This repository contains a **multi-task machine learning pipeline** to predict cytotoxicity of Neo-Tanshinlactone compounds across multiple cell lines using **molecular descriptors** generated from SMILES strings.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Load data**  
   Reads a CSV file containing compound information, SMILES strings, and cytotoxicity targets (MCF-7, SK-BR-3).

2. **Generate molecular descriptors**  
   Uses **RDKit** to compute all available molecular descriptors. Constant, NaN, or highly correlated descriptors are automatically removed.

3. **UMAP-Cluster-Based Train/Test Split**  
   - Perform KMeans clustering on UMAP embeddings.  
   - Use the **gap statistic** to determine the optimal number of clusters.  
   - Select test samples proportionally from each cluster, ensuring representative coverage.  
   - Split the dataset into `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test` using cluster-guided selection.

4. **Feature selection**  
   - Uses **MultiTaskLasso + Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to select top 15 features for all targets simultaneously.  
   - Uses **multi-task XGBoost model Feature Importance** to select top 15 features for all targets simultaneously.
   - Provides top 1–4 features for downstream modeling.

5. **Train multi-task regression models**  
   - Fits **multi-task GradientBoosting regression** using the selected descriptors.  
   - Evaluates models using R², MAE, MSE, RMSE, and leave-one-out R² metrics.  
   - Supports training with 1, 2, 3, up to 10 features combinations.
   - Supports the following models:

   ```python
   models = {
    
       "GB": MultiOutputRegressor(GradientBoostingRegressor()),
   }

6. **Save results**  
   - Trained model saved as `.pkl`.  
   - Models evaluation metrics saved as `.csv`.  
   - Selected features saved as `.csv`.

7. **Save plots**
   - All plots generated by the workflow will be saved in the output/plots directory:
   - Correlation plots – Scatter plots of experimental vs. predicted target values for each target.
   - Williams plot – Used for applicability domain visualization of the regression models.
   - ALE (Accumulated Local Effects) plots – Visualize feature effects on the predictions.
   - UMAP plot – 2D projection of the compounds based on descriptors.
   - UMAP + KMeans plot – Visualization of clustering on the UMAP embedding with cluster assignments.
